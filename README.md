# Animated chat fics

This repository contains the source code for the following animations:
* [Half Midnight In The Arse Crack Of Winter](https://irrationalpie7.github.io/biscuitverse6)
* [Save a Horse, Ride a Captain Sequel Snippets](https://irrationalpie7.github.io/junkyardscrapsch3)

These were inspired by [this animation](https://justoakleaf.github.io/kay2-has-entered-chat/index.html), available [on GitHub here](https://github.com/justoakleaf/kay2-has-entered-chat).

If you would like to add your own animation, check out the "helper-scripts" folder of this repository. You'll need all the files in there, plus to add your own animation-specific script and timing information. The readme in that folder has more details on the file formats and what you'll do with them.
